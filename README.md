This repo is for listing [my frontendmentor stuff](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Ativerc).

Deployed [here](https://avc-frontendmentor-stuff.netlify.app/).


## Notes for me!
### Starting a new challenge on FEM:
1. Download challenge.zip file
2. extract the folder inside it to a folder named `frontendmentor-stuff/N-frontendmentor-project-name/Solution`. N is the serial number of the project.
3. Remove `project-name/Solution/README-template.md`
   1. Use the `frontendmentor-stuff/myREADMEtemplate.md` to make the project's `README.md`. Don't use FEM's provided template. My template has been customised a bit.


### Completion Checklist:
- Take Screenshots for mobile and desktop solutions and put them in `project/Solution/screenshots`
- Final commit message for a project should be `feat: <frontendmentor-challenge-name> complete`
  - Any fixes should have commit message as `fix: <Project Name> - <What was fixed>`
  - Use https://www.conventionalcommits.org wherever possible.
- Update: 
  - the project's README.md with live and solution URLs, link to screenshots.
  - the root index.html with the links to the project.
- Commit message: `chore: Updated project's README.md and index.html`


### META TODO:
Write a script to automate these two checklists above. Hmmm!
