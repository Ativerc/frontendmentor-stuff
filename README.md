## Notes for me!
### Starting a new challenge on FEM:
1. Download challenge.zip file
2. extract the folder inside it to a folder named `frontendmentor-stuff/N-frontendmentor-project-name/Solution`. N is the serial number of the project.
3. Remove `project-name/Solution/README-template.md`
   1. Use the `frontendmentor-stuff/myREADMEtemplate.md` to make the project's `README.md`. Don't use FEM's provided template. My template has been customised a bit.


### Completion Checklist:
